	PUSH-SWAP
</h1>

The **Push_Swap** project involves sorting data in a stack using a limited set of operations while minimizing the total number of instructions. This challenge requires implementing and optimizing sorting algorithms for efficient data manipulation.

### Execution example
```
$>ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l
6
$>ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
OK
$>
```


## Instructions

To compile the project, run the `Makefile` in the terminal:

```bash
make

    

To clean up object files, run:

make clean



To remove all generated files, run:

make fclean



To compile the bonus:

make bonus



To recompile the project and the test executable, run:

make re
```
